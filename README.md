* Interesting data files:
    * There are error throwing data files that you can use to test our error throwing.
    * Species instructions for Darwin stored in resources/speciesdata
    * Style css files in resources/cellsociety/style/mystery that define color and style
    * Language property files in resources/cellsociety/lang have set values for each item for all
      locations
    * There are two (kind of) SimulationStyle.properties files:
        * One is stored within the properties file and acts as the default Simulation Styles for the
          User
        * The second one is dynamically made in the base directory to read and write the specific
          user Simulation Styles
            * This approach while not ideal works quite well and is what we ended up doing due to
              time constraints

* Key/Mouse inputs:
    * The only inputs needed are mouse clicking, mouse dragging, mouse scrolling and text inputs.
        * Mouse clicking are for the buttons, it is the main way user can interact with the
          controls.
        * Mouse dragging is for the sliders and window dragging. We implemented the docking system
          which we can drag the window to the edge of the screen and it will dock to the edge.
        * Mouse scrolling is for zooming in and out of the grid.
        * Text inputs are for the user to dynamically change the parameters for the simulation.

#### Configuration Assumptions/Simplifications

* All configuration files are XML.
    * It is possible to allow for non-XML configuration files its just that the XML constraint was
      made
* Saving a random total states or random total proportions will change the XML file to a normal one
    * The random total states and random total proportions allow for the randomly generated grid to
      be randomly generated.
      However, since the user is saving the grid, I am assuming they want to save the grid at that
      state. Thus, the states cannot be random.
      Do to this, the saved XML files will never be random total states nor random proportions.
* Darwin currently has 6 colors defined if a user wants to add a species they must change the cell
  color properties file
  and simulation properties files.

#### Logic Assumptions/Simplifications

* All Cell properties are doubles, and can only be doubles. When properties don't exist, they are
  set to zero automatically if pulled.
    * In the future, it would be better to use a record file. However, the need for properties other
      than doubles was not necessary until Darwin, when this property format was already heavily
      used.
* Grid is stored in a square format, even for triangle and hexagon. Triangle grids and hexagon grids
  were place onto the square grid.
    * This causes some discrepancies with Direction, as for example, up right for a hexagon is made
      to be Direction(-1, 1), when its actually a 60 degree angle. Despite this, all implementation
      should not break.
* BacteriaLogic and DarwinLogic use DUMMY enum variables instead of real enum states, as these
  simulations have a variable number of states. This makes implementing enums impossible, so the
  real value are stored in the cell properties instead under speciesID and coloredID.
* DarwinLogic implements the MOVE function by assuming one cell is one pixel. It did not make much
  sense to us to make species move pixels in a cell, as changing the size of the grid (either
  through settings or zooming in and out) would completely change the distance a species moved
  inside its cell.
    * Tracking the size of a cell also didn't make sense without a grid pixel size parameter. It
      would be possible with this parameter, but we decided to stick with the most
      basic implementation.
* In all models where objects or states move and can only hold one entity, it is assumed that
  they cannot move into where a entity was previously, even if the location would be empty on
  the next step.
    * In Wator, sharks eat fish before fishes can move.
    * In Darwin, species rotate first, then get infected, then move left or right if not infected.
* In Darwin, when a species reverts to its old species, it reverts to instruction 1.

#### View Assumptions/Simplifications

* The view is designed to be as flexible as possible, with the ability to add new simulations and
  dynamically change interact with the backend with the showing GUI.
* The simulation begins with a splash screen, and the user can choose the start-up theme and
  start-up
  language.
* The main window has 5 sections:
    * The control panel: This is the main control panel that allows the user to start, pause, load,
      reset. It also allows the user to save the current simulation states to the file.
    * The style panel: This panel allows the user to change the style of the simulation. The user
      can
      change the theme and the language of the simulation, and also change the style of the grid:
      Cell Shape, Edge Policy, and Neighbour Arrangement for the backend.
    * The grid panel: This panel shows the grid of the simulation. The user can zoom in and out of
      the
      grid, and also drag the grid to see different parts of the grid.
    * The info panel: This panel shows the information of the current simulation. It shows the
      current
      iterations, the author of the simulation, and the description of the simulation.
    * The parameter panel: This panel shows the parameters of the simulation. The user can change
      the
      parameters and the color of each simulation type of the simulation dynamically. The user can
      also change the parameters of the
      simulation by dragging the sliders.
* The view implements a docking system, where all the secions mentioned above will be docked to the
  edge of the window when the user drags the window to the edge of the target edge.
* Customized css files are used to define the style of the simulation. The css files are stored in
  resources/cellsociety/style/. The css files define the color and style of the simulation.

#### Logic Bugs

* FallingLogic looks for cells down left, down right, and down. With some implementations, shapes
  like hexagon do not have down left or down right on hexagons on the higher part of the row.
    * This means that cells can only go downward, despite there being a down left and down right,
      which are
      coded as Direction(0, -1) and Direction(0, 1) in neighbors instead. This is one of the
      aforementioned discrepancies with the square grid.
* When AntLogic looks for locations in the direction the ant is facing, it looks for all cells up,
  down, left, and right of the cell currently being looked at. For hexagon and triangle
  implementations, this might lead to unexpected possible directions.
* If DarwinLogic has an infinite loop, such as (GO 2, GO 1), the species breaks, and the code
  errors.
    * The idea I had was to set a timer in Logic, but this would require a bit more time to figure
      out.
* LifeLogic can't take in values bigger than 9, which could pose a problem for neighborhoods with
  more than 9 possible neighbors. Although it wouldn't error, it simply wouldn't take in the value.
    * With time, I would probably choose to implement letter values, like A = 10, B = 11, etc. For
      cells with very large neighborhoods greater than 36, I would most likely create a new way of
      implementing rulestrings that would take in comma seperated numbers.
* SugarScape can find the greatest value sugar pile in front of it, but due to changes made for
  Darwin, the sugar agent now teleports straight to the grid with the most sugar in its raycast.
    * The way that I would implement this would most likely be to raycast in all directions by using
      the getAllRaycastDirections, then see which direction contains the best direction, and go in
      that direction
* A lot of my Logic classes use strings to set parameters. A better way to do this would probably to
  make an enum, property file, or some other universal or hard to change value in order to prevent
  errors from spelling mistakes. I implemented this long before I realized the issue from the
  failing the codebase tests, so this would be an implementation for the future.
* Hexagon Grid MOORE neighbor assignment appears to be broken, at times not selecting the correct
  neighbors. I discovered this late, so did not have time to troubleshoot or fix this.

#### Configuration Bugs

* There are no-know bugs to the configuration writer.
    * The code writes the XMl document and as such the XMl document produced should not create any
      bugs.
* The current code in the configuration reader throws all errors to the view and I believe that it
  is "bug free" by my current software standards.
  This of course will change as users push the configuration functionality to its limit and/or more
  features are added.

#### View Bugs

* The color selector for the cell property will not affect the color of the cell until the user.
* The zoom in and out of the grid is not center to the grid widget, its zooming center is always the
  center of the grid, which is not correct.
* The text field input is checking the validity of the input by trying and catching the exception
  in the callback, which is unsafe.
    * The text field input data is not updating the simulation after the simulation get reset.
* The error dialog is keep popping up every frame when error occurs when user is running a
  simulation.

#### Configuration Unimplemented Features

* There is currently no implementation for the configAPI to set the ring (go to logic to understand
  this) of the neighbors.
    * While the ring parameter exists in the XMl is currently does nothing.
* I also could've added a way to store a color that wanted to be random in the properties file
    * This would've allowed users to choose random as a color preference, which could've led to some
      interesting simulations
    * We also discussed this as a way to color properties with no specific color assigned such as a
      new undefined species in Darwin.

#### Logic Unimplemented Features

* The ring for cell neighborhoods has not been implemented in the API. It is implemented in the XML
  and NeighborCalculator though. It would essentially get the ring of neighbors at radius x, and
  nothing else. This would fall under custom neighborhoods (logic used in NeighborCalculatorTest).
* Rulestrings greater than 9 for LifeLogic
* Non-double property values for Cells.
* SugarScape Spice simulation (Our choice for the 6th Generalize and Robust). It would theoretically
  just require adding more instance variables, setters, and getters, and a few slight modifications
  to Logic. We simply just did not have time.
* Edge Case grid mirroring has not been implemented, but would simply be another check and simple
  lines of logic in NeighborCalculator. The enums exist and would be handleable immediately upon
  implementation.
* Darwin instructions have not been translated to other languages. If they were, they would simply
  all be assigned to the english mapping used in naming the methods, essentially the same way that
  the shortened instruction names were translated to their longer names.

#### View Unimplemented Features

* The view does not have a way to change or interact with the cell in the simulation grid.
* The minigrid in the view is not showing bounds as a light outline within this view so the user
  knows what part of the simulation they are zoomed into.

#### Logic Features:

* Adding hexagons and triangles on a square grid are especially difficult, especially with differing
  neighborhoods and radii.
    * Hexagons go up and down in a row, depending on whether a cell
      is on an even or an odd indexed column. This means that the neighbor directions are different
      depending on the column. For triangles, the neighbor directions also change depending on
      whether the triangle faces up or faces down. This makes assigning neighbors rather difficult,
      as I would prefer not to hardcode a mapping for every permutation of edge type, neighborhood,
      cell shape, and radius.
    * I found that the difference between up and down hexagons and triangles is simply flipping
      their entire y value upside down. An upward facing MOORE triangle has a bottom left triangle
      of (1, -2) (the downward facing triangle down one, left two). This doesn't exist in a downward
      facing triangle, but the top left of the downward facing triangle's neighborhood is (1,-2). If
      you were to flip all the y coordinates, you would get the neighborhood for the other cell.
    * Using breadth first search, I can get all neighbors of a cell X cells away. I first find all
      of the neighbors of the cell. Then, I add all of those neighbors to a queue, and find all of
      the neighbors of each of those neighbors, essentially getting rings around the original
      neighbor. Through this process, I can find all neighbors x steps away from the original cell.
* Raycasting is essentially going out X cells in a specific direction.
    * This implementation is very easy for squares, but gets very difficult for triangles and
      hexagons. For triangles, what direction can you raycast? How do you define one direction? With
      the inconsistency of triangles having different directions for up and down on a square grid,
      how do you even go out in one direction?
    * In order to raycast, the neighbor calculator takes in the starting cell and row, and assigns
      the direction to a enum representing a direction based on the shape, and the starting row and
      starting column. It uses that enum as a key, and depending on the row and column of the next
      neighbor, choose the correct mapping of the enum direction to the Direction class, then add it
      as one of the neighbors.
    * Raycasting can be called in all directions (Sugarscape) or only in one direction (Darwin). It
      works with torus and base edge types, and can go out any variable amount of steps.
* DarwinHelper is a class that reads the species files, and parses instructions for a cell. It uses
  reflection in order to call specific methods in its class, passing in the correct argument. This
  way, it avoids a large case statement for instructions.

#### View Features:

* The auto-fitting grid outlines. The grid will automatically calculate the outside border of
  the current grid.
* The zooming in and out of the grid. The user can zoom in and out of the grid by the zooming
  gestures or scrolling the mouse wheel.
* The docking system. The user can dock the sections of the window to the edge of the window by
  dragging the window to the edge of the section windows.

#### Configuration Features:

* The two API abstraction.
    * The entire model and configuration packages and all their functionality (that we want to show)
      are managed by two API's.
        * The configAPI class manages all the configuration aspects of the project.
        * The modelAPI class manages all the model aspects of the project:
            * Meaning it handles: the grid, logic, cells, cell colors, and style preferences.
            * The API has helper classes which abstract out methods and increases the readability of
              the API.

### Assignment Impressions

Jacob: Overall, I think this assignment really improved my current knowledge of proper coding
practices, and greatly enhanced how well designed I can make my code. Every update seemed to break
my code, but every time it still seemed to be MOSTLY doable. It made it very obvious how important
designing the project is, as simple misjudgements (using enums for states) can reverberate
throughout the entire project. I do wish that we got slight nudges or hints towards the different
ways that we would eventually have to implement our code (if we were asked stuff like what if the
number of states changed?) or had some understanding that there would eventually be new features
added on, but I also understand why this might not be the case. Overall, I think this was a great
(but slightly brutal) way to introduce us to standard design principles and coding practices.

Hsuan-Kai Liao: This assignment is a great opportunity for me to learn how to design a project with
collaboration with teammates. I learned a lot about how to design a project with a clear structure
and how to strongly follow the rules of Model View Separation. I also learned how to write a design
document before the team actually code. At the beginning of the project, I was struggling with how
to
balance the time between the design document and the actual coding. I spent a lot of time on working
on cool front end functionality like docking system and zooming in and out of the grid, but the more
I communicate with my teammates, the more I realize that the design is more important for a large
project to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and new feature can be easily added.
Overall,
I think this assignment allows me to understand deeper in both the design and the coding in a team.

Billy: I enjoyed the assignment. I found that working on the backend was quite an enjoyable
experience.
I expanded my coding knowledge base and encountered new ideas and better ways to abstract my code. I
also got so much better at figuring out how to separate different methods into different purposes.
This
helped me a lot when trying to figure out abstraction for the configReader class as well as the
API's.
I also became a lot better at refactoring. When making the API's I spent a lot of time refactoring
code to make it
more flexible. I also spent a lot of time working to reduce my method complexity. I feel more
confident now
with the code that I write and my own ability to improve the code that I and other people right. The
assignment
was also interesting as the group aspect made it much more fun and dynamic. In general, I would say
this assignment
strengthened my coding practices and increased my enjoyment of coding.
